# Basic Finite State Machine

**Wikipidia says:**
> A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two typesâ€”deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines. A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.

This project contains a basic implementation of a Finite-State Machine for unity with C#.
I (varollo) use this project to simplify my games and apps, and have it on my github as part of my portfolio.

Feel free to use it in your projects.
